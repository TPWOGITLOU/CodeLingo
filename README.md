# [CodeLingo](https://codelingo-by-tpwogitlou.netlify.app/)
**Brief**
CodeLingo was built as a final project and represents the conclusion of our [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) Software Development Bootcamp. Our project brief was simple: 

> "Develop a full-stack application on a subject of your choosing."

The catch, however, was that it must include technologies *not* taught on the course.

**What is CodeLingo?**
As a team, we liked the idea of building an educational tool for those wanting to learn the basics of a programming language. As a team, we had used tools like Duolingo, Scratch, and Kahoot before and liked the interactive aspects of them, as well as how intuitive and engaging they were. Over a couple of days of idea development and spiking, we decided on the basis of what would become CodeLingo.
